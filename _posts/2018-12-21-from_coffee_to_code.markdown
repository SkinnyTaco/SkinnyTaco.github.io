Growing up, computers were never really "my thing." And while I did play videogames, most of my hobbies involved sports, particularly combat sports; science, which I would later study in university; or some sort of husbandry,  beekeeping in my case. I was, and still am, always behind in the latest social media trends, as most my friends can attest to, and I always viewed liking computers with a weird stigma I could not seem to shake until relatively recently.

Fast-forward to the end of my college days, it turns out I did not want to be a biologist...or a doctor, or a teacher. I was pretty lost, and always ended up defaulting to the vocation that felt safe and played to my strengths -- restaurant management. I have gone from sushi, to ramen, to ice cream, and now coffee. While all of these have been great experiences, none of them quite fit what I see myself doing 10 years from now, and that is the problem. 

My last quarter at the University of Washington, I needed one more elective so I scoured the course catalog and found CSE 101: Intro to Programming. We learned about the basics of programming in Java, and by the time I was done digesting all the loops, data structures, and file streams, I was hooked! It played to my liking for puzzles, and solving various problems (think sudoku and chess). All I wanted to do was ask every developer/engineer how they came be where they are now. Luckily, my place of work happens to be a haven for code slingers. Every time I saw an IDE pulled up on a screen, I made it my job to ask if I could pick their brain, get a card, and/or set up a meeting with them to discuss. Everyone was super understanding and receptive, and I ultimately sat down with probably twenty people over a couple months' time.

The stories people had to tell me surprisingly varied to an extreme degree. Some grew up coding, some began in their early 30's, some taught themselves in two years, and others spent seven years paying going into debt before they got where they were. They were all different, but at the end of the day they all had something in common: they all proved they could code, regardless of their age or background. This fact, along with the support of my partner, was ultimately what gave me the confidence to pursue the long road to coding.

That brings us to the here and now. My journey, from coffee to code.
