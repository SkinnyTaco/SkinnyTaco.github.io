After being in the online program at Flatiron for a little over a month now, I am proud to say I have almost completed my first project. While I love learning how to code in of itself, projects are really where I tend to shine. I have always been a hands-on learner, and building things with code often allows me the opportunity to tap into other hobbies I have, which makes everything just a little less intimidating.

For the CLI project, I decided to indulge my hobby of following NCAA wrestling. I was a wrestler in high school, but never had the opportunity to wrestle at my college, as they didn't have a team at the time. The features of my CLI are pretty simple:

1. Access the top 20 wrestlers at each weight class, and
2. Have a details screen for each wrestler.

Pretty simple, right? 

I really appreciated how building this allowed me to practice numerous concepts, particularly seperation of concerns and object collaboration. In a study group I attended where we learned to talk about our code, I realized adhering to these concepts allowed me to focus on discussing the actual meat of my code, instead of spending time wondering where everything lived. The concepts of scalability and how unorganized code can quickly turn to "spaghetti" also became very apparent to me during this project.

The final step was turning all my hard work into a gem. I hardly knew what I was getting myself into. Nothing I tried worked, but through grinding away at the ruby documentation, I eventually succeeded in finding all the problems with my code. In fact, a lot of it wasn't even my code, but the defaults that come with 'gem bundle.' 

After debugging through all my gemspec problems, I finally was able to push my gem up. The moment I got to install my gem from a different computer was so satisfying!

I realize, however, that my code isn't perfect. I look forward to my review, and all the feedback that comes with it. Above all, I think it's safe to say I love building with code :)
